       <p>"I am a retired Merchant Navy Master Mariner living in Mumbai (now shifted to Udupi, Karnataka). I am the youngest brother of Tapovani Mata Sant Subhadra from her ‘poorvashram’ and have been part of her religious and social activities through the Gangori Ashram, Uttarkashi, for a long time. I am also one of the trustees of Tapovani Mata Sant Subhadra Charitable Trust and have been instrumental in carrying out Medical camps, setting up of Primary healthcare centre and providing free tuitions to needy children through the Gangori ashram.
"</p>
		  
		  
		  
		  <p>"The idea of forming Arunoday Foundation came up to keep social activities separated from religious activities and to involve local people in their own development, to carry forward promotion of ‘Shiksha, Swasthya and Sanskar’ as preached by Tapovani Mata, particularly in the remote villages of Uttarkashi.
"</p>
		  
		  
		  <p>"It could begin at any one of the remote villages in Uttarkashi. It happened in Juguldi village because of meeting of the minds of Gajendra Singh, a post Graduate from this village, and me. Gajendra offered his land and building for the school as well as his full time commitment for this cause.

       <p>"When I went to Harshil, Dharali and Gangotri in the year 2003 on painting work I met Mataji while I was writing the sign boards. Mataji asked me to write something in the Ashram & I wrote that. Mataji wanted to give me some money. I did not take that money because I loved monks and Holy people. Then Mataji invited me to dinner. That day was very cold and it was snowing. I was poor that time & I had a thin sweater. When I entered the Kutiya Mataji gave me a jacket telling me you are feeling very cold. It made me very comfortable. Mataji gave me something to eat. My mother expired when I was a small child. Mataji loved me as a mother then asked me where l stayed. I said I am staying in a hotel. Mataji told me to stay in the ashram while working in Dharali, Mukhba. So Ashram became my home and Mataji my mother. I was very comfortable there. I was painting whole day and stayed at the Ashram. I saved money and also served monks visiting Mataji’s ashram. That routine continued to 6to 7 years.
"</p>
		  
		  
		  
		  <p>"I did some writing work at Gangori Ashram also. Whenever Mataji had some painting work in the ashram she called me & I did it very happily with full responsibility. Once there was a ‘Bhagavat Sapthah’ in the Ashram by Keshava Muniji and I participated to serve for 15 days. Bahadur Singh Vermaji asked Mataji, is Gajendra a brahmin boy? Then Mataji said to him, ‘he is a brahmin for me’.

"</p>
		  
		  
		  <p>"Mataji also sent me to free Medical camps at Harshil, Dharali and Jhala etc. Narenderji was serving there. I was not familiar with him that time. He silently gave me 500 rupees for my expenses.  Nobody can see & I don’t understand what is happening. But after sometime my respect for him increased in my heart. Thereafter I always attended to social service works. I don’t know what Narendraji thinks about me. Slowly we became familiar with each other. In 2014 Narendraji said to me ‘Gajendra I want to start some social work if I have your co-operation, just think about that’. I was working that time in the conservative organic plan contracted by NABARD. I had experience of working village to village through NABARD organization of 7-8 years. Then October, 2015, he called me and asked what you thought about that. After sometime I met Narendra sir and decided to open a school with mataji’s ideals and blessings. Main purpose of opening school was to give modern and quality education to rural and poor children and to stop the escape of villagers to cities for children’s education. I had rooms also in the Juguldi (Uttarkashi) and farm too. I started the school in those rooms and now we have classes from pre-primary up to 4th standard there with 70 plus students in our school. 

"</p>
		  
		  
		  
		  <p>"While working, I pursued studies and I have managed to become a postgraduate (M.A.). I have also completed D.El.Ed to be a qualified teacher. I also participated in social work activities conducted by various NGO’s in Uttarkashi.

        <p>"I was born in Dharali, a village close to Gangotri, which gets cut off from the rest of the world for about 4 months of winter every year even today. I have known Tapovani Mata since childhood as her humble cottage was in Dharali and my mother was one of her devout followers. Mataji took keen interest in my studies throughout and our lifetime bond continued after I became a Doctor. I am practicing at Ramakrishna Mission Hospital, Kankhal, Haridwar, where Mataji was being treated for a long time and I became her trusted Doctor."</p>
		  
		  
		  <p>"I have personal experience of the difficulties the children of remote Himalayan villages face as I have gone through the whole process to graduate and get a medical degree. I see the urgent need for good schools in disconnected villages and gladly joined forces with Arunoday Foundation formed by the followers of Tapovani Mata to achieve that goal. Providing healthcare and health education together with normal education is essential to the villagers. I am a participant in providing medical checkups and health education to the school children and their parents.

This was very difficult for me. That is why I became a member of Arunoday Foundation which has opened an English medium school in the village. I am so happy that village children are getting good education in the village.
