			<p class="text-justify p-4">Arunoday Foundation was formed/registered on 25th of Feb 2016. The mission of the foundation is to provide quality education and healthcare to the rural children. The inspiration comes from Tapovani Mata Sant Subhadra’s drive to spread ‘Shiksha, Swasthya and Sanskar’. The founder Narendra Shetty and General Secretary Gajendra Singh have been followers of Tapovani Mata for a long time.
A beginning has been made taking a tough challenge. A pre-primary school has been opened at a remote mountain village called Juguldi in Uttarkashi, with no transport or other amenities, 5 km away from nearest tar road. Medical check-up of the school children and their parents will be done at regular intervals and a record will be maintained. Healthcare and hygiene education will be provided to parents at every Parents meeting. The endeavor is to create a successful sustainable model and then replicate the model in other such villages.
Why English Medium? : Fortunately Electric power has reached most of the villages in Uttarkhand and with that the TV, but not the internet. There is awareness among the villagers. They, especially the mothers want good education for their children. It is unfortunate that the rural Govt schools are not satisfying the aspirations of the parents in spite of the huge amount of money Govt is spending in establishing schools and paying good salary to teachers. Lot of parents believe, even in the villages, that non-government English medium schools are what their children need. This is what we aspire to provide.  </p>

			<p class="text-justify p-4">It is our belief that English medium education will open wider horizon for the children to acquire knowledge as well as employment in the fast digitizing world.There is no reason why a student from a village should not be on an equal footing with the student from a city when it comes to higher education or high-tech job.
Why Juguldi village? : Gajendra Singh, a post Graduate, from the village was ready to give up his job and devote his entire time to run the school. He also offered his land for building the school. Some other likeminded villagers have agreed to participate and joined the trust to manage the school. Outside help is needed only to fund the infrastructure and provide qualified teachers. This model can be and will be replicated in other villages where such local commitment is available.
Present status of activity: The school has a building with 4 class rooms + office + 2 toilets, sufficient playground, Nursery, Jr.KG & Sr.KG classes with 50 plus students and 3 teachers. A computer was provided by Mr. Dheeraj Kaushik of Delhi, to familiarize the children and download/play study materials. Residence is provided to visiting teachers. A vehicle is provided to transport teachers to & from nearest township to the school.</p>

			<p class="text-justify p-4"><ol><li>Funds are very welcome of course in any amount. More funds we have more amenities we can provide to the children. Teachers need to be paid a decent salary which the villagers cannot afford. Future addition of infrastructure and land also requires funds. It is possible to name the class rooms after big donors.</li><br>
			
			<li>Good teacher willing to work in remote villages is extremely hard to find. We welcome educated volunteers who are willing to spend some time with our children. We will provide a decent living space and transport. For nature loving city dwellers we provide excellent escape, absolutely quiet, clean & peaceful environment. The place is close to heaven for spiritually oriented.
